// B-Trees are complex data structures that require an extensive implementation. Here's a simplified example of a B-Tree node:


// Definition: A self-balancing search tree that allows more than two children per node, useful for disk-based storage.

// Example: Storing and searching large amounts of data efficiently.

// Use Case: B-Trees are commonly used in databases and file systems to efficiently store and retrieve large datasets with a low memory overhead.


// Code Example: 

class BTreeNode {
  constructor(order) {
    this.order = order; // Maximum number of children
    this.keys = [];
    this.children = [];
  }
}


// The complete implementation of B-Trees is beyond the scope of a code snippet due to their complexity.
