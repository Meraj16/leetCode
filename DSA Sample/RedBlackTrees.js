// Definition: A self-balancing binary search tree where nodes are colored red or black, maintaining balance during insertions and deletions.

// Example: Efficient searching, sorting, and range-based queries with automatic balancing.

// Use Case: Red-Black trees are useful for scenarios that require self-balancing trees to maintain efficiency and ensure worst-case time complexity.

// Code Example:
let redBlackTree = new RedBlackTree();
redBlackTree.insert(5);
redBlackTree.insert(3);
console.log(redBlackTree.search(3)); 
// Output: true
