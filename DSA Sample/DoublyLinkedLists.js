// Definition: A linked list where each node has a reference to both the next and the previous node.

// Example: Implementing a data structure that supports forward and backward traversal.

// Use Case: Doubly linked lists are useful for scenarios that require efficient forward and backward traversal, such as implementing a browser history.

// Code Example:

class DoublyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
  }
}

let list = new DoublyLinkedList();

// Insertion and other operations can be implemented.
